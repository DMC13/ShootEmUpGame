This project is a 2D top-down shoot â€™em up inspired by the mobile game *Last War: Survival*. (click [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/ce1X2ozlQ6A) to watch the game video on YouTube).

After seeing ads for the game countless times, I decided to ***recreate it for fun*** while also ***exploring the power of generative AI*** in software development. Most of the code was written with the assistance of **ChatGPT-4o**, making this project both a coding challenge and an experiment in AI-assisted game creation.

In this game, the player controls a soldier positioned at the bottom of the screen, tasked with defending a bridge from waves of enemies. The player can move left and right while shooting upward, eliminating approaching enemies before they reach the base. The game features power-ups, different weapons, and increasing difficulty to keep the gameplay engaging and challenging.
